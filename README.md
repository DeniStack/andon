# Andon connection
This Python script is part of an application that interacts with two different databases, a Firebird SQL database (fb_conn) and a Microsoft SQL Server database (ms_sql_conn). The purpose of the application seems to involve querying data from the Firebird database, processing it, and then inserting it into the Microsoft SQL Server database.
